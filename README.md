# ‚öæ Baseball Scoreboard Project

## Overview

This project began during one of my baseball classes, where my coach mentioned wanting a custom scoreboard. With my experience in IoT and a curiosity about electronics, I eagerly took on the challenge. What started as a simple idea turned into an incredible journey involving hands-on experimentation, multiple trips to local markets, and a lot of trial and error. Here‚Äôs the full story of how I built a functional Bluetooth-controlled scoreboard from scratch.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Setup and Components

### Key Components and Initial Research
- **Microcontroller**: ESP32 (chosen for its Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities)
- **LED Control**: TM1638 IC (initially recommended for multiplexing)
- **Display**: 8 seven-segment displays and 9 LEDs for visibility
- **Power Supply**: 24V, 12A switching power supply
- **Additional Tools**: Transistors, resistors, SMD-to-DIP converters, heat sinks, and aluminum for heat dissipation

The first steps were filled with research and sourcing. I started at Amjad Mall in Iran, asking shop owners about the components I‚Äôd need. After several conversations, I found a shopkeeper who guided me toward the TM1638 IC, which uses time multiplexing to control multiple segments and LEDs. I also picked up an ESP32 for Bluetooth and Wi-Fi support.

## üèóÔ∏è Building the Prototype

### 1. Learning from Mistakes
After gathering my components, I faced my first major hurdle: the TM1638 IC I had purchased was an SMD (Surface-Mount Device), which made it challenging to work with on a standard breadboard. I went to a local electronics shop in Karaj and finally found a helpful LED shop owner who explained how to manage the heat and power requirements for the high-intensity LEDs that would be visible outdoors. Armed with new knowledge, I purchased aluminum heat sinks and test LEDs.

### 2. Power Calculations and Setup
To ensure sufficient brightness, I calculated the power requirements for the LEDs. With 49 segments needing 350mA each, I determined I‚Äôd need a power supply of at least 6V and 15A. I opted for a 24V, 12A power supply, confident it could handle the load. This setup also required a SMD-to-DIP converter to make the IC compatible with my breadboard.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Challenges, Failures, and Discoveries

### Transistor Troubles and Explosions
One of my biggest challenges was figuring out how to control high-power LEDs with the ESP32, which outputs a maximum of 3V. Remembering a lesson on transistors from a university course, I decided to use them to manage the current. However, during testing, I miscalculated the current, causing one of the transistors to explode! After more research, I discovered that transistors have maximum current limits. I then experimented with stronger transistors, only to find that the ESP32‚Äôs 3V output wasn‚Äôt enough to activate them.

### Discovering the Dual-Transistor Solution
This was a point where I nearly gave up, but a senior at university suggested using a smaller transistor to control the larger one, creating a dual-transistor circuit. This solution worked, allowing me to control the LEDs with the ESP32‚Äôs limited output!

### Soldering and Testing on Perfboard
Once I had my circuit figured out, I decided to build on a perfboard instead of a custom PCB to save costs. This decision came with its own difficulties. I spent two weeks soldering LEDs, connecting segments, and ensuring each connection was solid with a multimeter. While tedious, this phase taught me the value of precision and patience in electronics.

## ‚ö° Lessons Learned and Final Assembly

### Resistor Calculations for LED Protection
As I powered the board, I noticed some LEDs burning out. Realizing I hadn‚Äôt accounted for the resistor wattage, I recalculated the resistance needed and came across a 9V regulator that simplified my circuit. With this, I could use 8-ohm, 1-watt resistors, ensuring each LED was properly protected without excessive heat.

### Final Assembly and Debugging
After weeks of assembling, soldering, and troubleshooting, I powered on the scoreboard for the first time. Although some LEDs didn‚Äôt light up immediately, seeing it come to life was incredibly rewarding. I fixed minor bugs, adjusted connections, and secured each part, then programmed the ESP32 to control the scoreboard via Bluetooth.

## üöÄ Future Plans

1. **Android App**: To make the scoreboard even more interactive, I plan to develop an Android app for Bluetooth control.
2. **Custom PCB**: To improve reliability and reduce errors, I‚Äôd like to design a custom PCB in future iterations.

## üéâ Conclusion

This project taught me resilience, problem-solving, and the intricacies of electronics. Each challenge brought new learning opportunities, from basic circuit design to complex power management. It‚Äôs a testament to the rewards of hands-on experimentation, and I‚Äôm excited to continue building and refining projects like this.
